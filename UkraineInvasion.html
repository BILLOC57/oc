Sometimes I can’t sleep through the night. Sometimes I wake up with thoughts rolling around in my mind like clothes in a washing machine. Today I was thinking about the war in Ukraine. </p>

<p>
Internecine fighting is the worst. I mean, the two sides have so much in common. They share the Cyrillic alphabet. They can mostly understand each other’s spoken language. Ukrainian is sort of a dialect of Russian. You would think that the warm blanket of a united Russia would have great appeal. 
</p>

<p>
That unfortunately is not how it’s playing out. Instead Russians are slaughtering people that they so regard as their countrymen that they desperately want those people’s country to be part of Russia. </p>

<p>
I know that it makes limited sense. That’s politics; political boundaries & power, just look at history. 
</p>

<p>
Does invading Ukraine remind you of our Country’s Civil War? It has the same deeply divisive aspects with wounds that we suffer to this day.

How about Ireland? I am the son of a Refugee. My grandfather owned a pub in Belfast that was known as an IRA hang out. When the shooting started in the 1920’s all related O’Connor males instantly had a price on their heads. Had you killed any of them then the protestants would have paid you a bounty; a good reason to get out of town. It was also a good reason to show up at Ellis Island and ask for asylum.

The whole story is as old as time itself. Ancient Greece had a handful of city states, each with its own fertile plane, separated by mountain ranges. Enjoying the beneficent climate of latitude 38, like Rome, New York, and San Francisco they thrived. Their successes led to hundreds of years of war with each other. Epic were the struggles and dizzying alliances between Sparta, Athens, and Thebes.  The birthplace of Western Civilization was forged in Wars.

<p>
Yet they were the same racially identical people.

In the same way it is sad to see Russia, which has a glorious culture, tradition, & history in Science and the Arts, behaving so badly. Whatever legitimate security issues they had are now moot on the world stage. They instead seem bent on a War of naked territorial expansion which is not a good look.
