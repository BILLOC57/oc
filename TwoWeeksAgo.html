<h2>True Story</h2>

<p>Two weeks ago, I think it was Wednesday, I was writing software. I was so focused on what I was doing that all I had for dinner was a Pop Tart. What is interesting though is how I got there. </p>
<p>Recently I started streaming engineering content on YouTube. Eventually I came upon a video from a nerdy girl (Freya Holmer) called ‘The Beauty of Bezier Curves’. She writes video games and like me she was interested in them b/c she made use of them in her work. She took a year off and researched them to learn more, leading to a one-hour video she also made about splines. </p>
<p>Now that is something I have been obsessed with since childhood. A spline is a particular type of curve with the property that it passes through the control points that you use to draw it. They show in 2D the intersection of multiple planes with a 3D surface. Multiples of such views represent the hull of a ship, the airfoil of an aircraft wing, a propeller, or a turbine blade. </p>
<p>In the world that I was born into splines were created manually, at full-scale even for a ship or an aircraft. The process was called lofting.* Draftsmen created them out of dimensions taken from scale models. They used wooden strips called battens held in place by ‘ducks’, cast iron weights with hooks on the end that were the size and shape of a computer mouse. Smoothing the curves involved moving the ducks around to get rid of any irregularities. </p>
<p>Needless to say I’ve been fascinated with how this could now easily be done on a computer. Well she spelled it all out. There it all was the mathematical description along with the history of how it came about! She had this really cool way of putting the equations into a matrix format. I was more interested in the underlying equations but it impressed me. </p>
<p>Armed with some newfound understanding I turned my attention to a cam surface in a part that I am designing for 3D printing. It had been giving me trouble but I soon found out how to reproducibly describe it with a quadratic Bezier curve. Of course the story doesn’t end there. </p>
<p>Almost immediately I needed to do analytic geometry on the surface. That in turn meant performing calculus on the equation for the curve. I tried doing so in MathCad which I’m pretty good at but all I could get was a numeric solution not a symbolic one. Give my background I should have been able to work out a solution symbolically but I didn’t trust my skills enough. </p>
<p>So I turned to my friendly neighborhood Artificial Intelligence Chat Bot. I asked for the derivative of the equation. The result came back on the first try. It was perfect, exactly what I wanted and was so polite. It recognized the equation as appearing to describe a Bezier curve, rewrote it in a different order and, gave a term by term explanation of each derivative. That was pretty impressive. </p>

<p>* Shipyards always contained buildings called Molding Lofts which is where the process gets its name. They needed to have an unobstructed floor large enough to contain the full size lines of a ship. You can visit one of these in Marinship in Sausalito. A section of it now houses something called the Bay Model that is a scale model of the terrain of the Bay Area and the Delta. It actually contains water and was built so that hydrological issues could be studied. </p>
