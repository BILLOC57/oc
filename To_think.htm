<h2>War and Pandemics</h2>
</div>
<hr>
<div>
<p>Think about it. War is the perfect metaphor for our current pandemic situation. </p>

<p>I&#39; ve live through several wars, Vietnam, a couple of Gulf ones, &amp; our longest one: Afghanistan.</p>

<p>Starting with and including Vietnam every single one of them did not affect the home front at all.</p>

<p>That&#39; s why they weren&#39; t Total Wars which definitely have a massive effect on the home front. I call the other ones Hobbyist Wars by the way. </p>

<p>Today the whole War is being fought on the home front, including the casualties! Even more amazingly the home front is the whole World!</p>

<p>I&#39; m a Baby Boomer; I grew up with pictures &amp; stories about WWII. I&#39; ve even seen my Mother&#39; s ration coupon book.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That perfectly illustrates how in Total War everyone sacrifices and loses some of their freedom ‘For the Duration&#39; . </p>

<p>Nothing is expected from you that isn&#39; t expected from everyone. </p>

<p>That&#39; s why it enrages me that some politicians lead some people to think that they have a special right to whine about the burden. To exploit that politically is to intentionally promote Disloyalty during War. It&#39; s worse than desertion under fire. It&#39; s purposeful Sabotage of the War Effort on the Battlefield. </p>

<p>Worse, this same fifth column ruined our all-important initial defense with ineptitude. I&#39; m talking about Testing of course, and it gets worse. </p>

<p>More than three months into this fight they are still doing everything they can to withhold Testing from the United States of America. </p>

<p>That&#39; s because they&#39; re so superficial that they&#39; re preoccupied with appearances and think that more Testing makes more case numbers which looks bad. </p>

<p>It&#39; s sort of like attempting censorship of reality. Our Nation suffers the consequences and will continue to.</p>
