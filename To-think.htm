<h2>War and Pandemics</h2>
</div>
<hr>
<div>
<p>Think about it. War is the perfect metaphor for our current pandemic situation. </p>

<p>I’ve live through several wars, Vietnam, a couple of Gulf ones, &amp; our longest one: Afghanistan.</p>

<p>Starting with and including Vietnam every single one of them did not affect the home front at all.</p>

<p>That’s why they weren’t Total Wars which definitely have a massive effect on the home front. I call the other ones Hobbyist Wars by the way. </p>

<p>Today the whole War is being fought on the home front, including the casualties! Even more amazingly the home front is the whole World!</p>

<p>I’m a Baby Boomer; I grew up with pictures &amp; stories about WWII. I’ve even seen my Mother’s ration coupon book.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That perfectly illustrates how in Total War everyone sacrifices and loses some of their freedom ‘For the Duration’. </p>

<p>Nothing is expected from you that isn’t expected from everyone. </p>

<p>That’s why it enrages me that some politicians lead some people to think that they have a special right to whine about the burden. To exploit that politically is to intentionally promote Disloyalty during War. It’s worse than desertion under fire. It’s purposeful Sabotage of the War Effort on the Battlefield. </p>

<p>Worse, this same fifth column ruined our all-important initial defense with ineptitude. I’m talking about Testing of course, and it gets worse. </p>

<p>More than three months into this fight they are still doing everything they can to withhold Testing from the United States of America. </p>

<p>That’s because they’re so superficial that they’re preoccupied with appearances and think that more Testing makes more case numbers which looks bad. </p>

<p>It’s sort of like attempting censorship of reality. Our Nation suffers the consequences and will continue to.</p>
